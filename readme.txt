Retrieves a custom news feed and displays it in a widget on the admin dashboard

== Description ==

This plugin will allow you to specify a custom news feed to display in widget on the admin dashboard. This works in unison with the `Dashboard Custom Feed Admin` plugin which creates the feed.

This is mainly useful for notifying all your clients of something through their wordpress dashboard, whether that be a link to a new blog you've written or a notification asking everyone to upgrade their versions of wordpress. It's really up to you what you show in there.

== Installation ==


1. Upload `/Dashboard-Custom-Feed/` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Go to `Settings > DCF Settings` and enter the URL of the feed
